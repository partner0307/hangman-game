# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game made with Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `index.py` file in the terminal.
2. The game will choose a random word from a list of words and display it as underscores.
3. Guess one letter at a time by typing it in the terminal.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will replace the corresponding underscore(s). If not, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word or the hangman is complete.

## Features

- The game has a list of over 100 words to choose from.
- The hangman is drawn using ASCII art.
- You can only guess one letter at a time, and it must be a letter of the alphabet.
- The game keeps track of the letters you have guessed and tells you if you have already guessed a letter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
